# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe in Ruby. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and each player takes turns marking a space with their symbol (either "X" or "O"). The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

I built this game to practice using Ruby classes and object-oriented programming.

## Running the Game

To run the game, clone the repository and run this command in the project directory:

```bash
ruby run.rb
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, first install the RSpec gem:

```bash
gem install rspec
```

Then run this command in the project directory:

```bash
rspec ./spec
```
